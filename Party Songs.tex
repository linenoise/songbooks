\[F#m]I was puzzled \[Em]by a dream, 
\[D]stayed with me all \[G]day in 19\[A]95 \[G]

From my \[A]crippled friend \[G]
\[F#m]She was not im\[Em]pressed that 
I \[D]cured her on the \[G]Sabbath

There \[D]was a pregnant \[G]pause

I was a \[G]lonely \[D]teenage \[Em]broncin' buck with a 
\[Am]pink carnation and a \[C]pickup truck
But I \[G]knew I \[D]was \[Em]out of luck 
the \[C]day the \[D7]music \[G]died, \[C]I started \[G]singin'
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
Now for \[G]ten years we've been \[Am]on our own,
and \[C]moss grows fat on a \[Am]rolling stone but \
[Em]that's not how it \[D]used to be
When the \[G]jester \[D]sang for the \[Em]king and queen 
in a \[Am7]coat he borrowed \[C]from James Dean in a 
\[Em]voice that \[A7]came from you and \[D]me
And \[Em]while the king was \[D]looking down, the 
\[Em]jester stole his \[D]thorny crown
The \[C]courtroom \[G]was \[A7]adjourned, 
no \[D7]verdict was returned
And while \[G]Lenin \[D]read a \[Em]book on Marx, 
the \[Am]quartet practiced \[C]in the park
And \[G]we sang \[D]dirges \[Em]in the dark 
the day\[C] the \[G]music \[C]died, we were \[G]singin'
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse


\beginverse
\[G]Helter skelter \[Am]in a summer swelter
\[C]the birds flew off with a \[Am]fallout shelter, 
\[Em]eight miles high and \[D]fallin' fast
It \[G]landed \[D]foul \[Em]on the grass
the \[Am7]players tried for a \[C]forward pass, 
with the \[Em]jester on the \[A7]sidelines in A \[D]cast
Now at \[Em]halftime there was \[D]sweet perfume, 
while \[Em]sergeants played a \[D]marching tune
\[C]We all got \[G]up to \[A7]dance, 
but we \[D7]never got the chance
'Cuz the \[G]players \[D]tried to \[Em]take the field, 
the \[Am]marching band re\[C]fused to yield
Do \[G]you \[D]recall what \[Em]was the feel 
the \[C] day the \[D7]music \[G]died, \[C]we started \[G]singin'
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
And \[G]there we were all \[Am]in one place,
a \[C]generation \[Am]lost in space, 
with \[Em]no time left to \[D]start again
So come on \[G]Jack be \[D]nimble, 
\[Em]Jack be quick, \[Am7]Jack Flash sat on a \[C]candle 
stick, cause \[Em]fire is the \[A7]devil's only \[D]friend
And \[Em]as I watched him \[D]on the stage, 
my \[Em]hands were clenched in \[D]fists of rage
No \[C]angel \[G]born in \[A7]Hell 
could \[D7]break that Satan's spell
And as the \[G]flames climbed \[D]high in\[Em]to the night 
to \[Am]light the sacri\[C]ficial rite
I saw \[G]Satan \[D]laughing with \[Em]delight 
the \[C]day the \[D7]music \[G]died, \[C]he was \[G]singin'
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
I \[G]met a \[D]girl who \[Em]sang the blues
And I \[Am]asked her for some \[C]happy news, 
but \[Em]she just smiled and \[D]turned away
I \[G]went \[D]down to the \[Em]sacred store
Where I'd \[Am]heard the music \[C]years before, 
but the \[Em]man there said the \[C]musicwouldn't \[D]play
But \[Em]in the streets \[Am]the children screamed, 
the \[Em]lovers cried and the \[Am]poets dreamed
But \[C]not a \[G]word was \[Am]spoken, 
the \[C]church bells all were \[D]broken
And the \[G]three men \[D]I ad\[Em]mire most, 
the \[Am7]Father, \[C]Son, and the \[D7]Holy Ghost
\[G]They caught the \[D]last train \[Em]for the coast 
the \[Am7]day the \[D7]music \[G]died,
\[D7]And they were singin'

\[E]Pathological monsters! cried the \[A]terrified mathema\[F#m]tician
Every \[A]one of them is a \[B7]splinter in my \[E]eye
I hate the \[E]Peano Space and the Koch Curve
I fear the \[A]Cantor Ternary \[F#m]Set
The Sier\[A]pinski Gasket \[B7]makes me want to cry \[E]
And a \[A7]million miles \[E7]away a \[A7]butterfly \[E7]flapped its wings
On a \[A7]cold November \[E7]day.. a \[F#m]man named Benoit \[B7]Mandelbrot was \[E]born
\endverse

\beginverse
\[E]His disdain for pure mathematics and his \[A]unique geometrical \[F#m]insights
Left him \[A]well equipped to \[B7]face those demons down\[E]
He saw that \[E]infinite complexity could be \[A]described by simple \[F#m]rules
He used his \[A]giant brain to \[B]turn the game around\[E]
And he \[A7]looked below the storm and \[E7]saw a vision in his head
A \[A7]bulbous pointy form\[E7]
He picked his \[F#m]pencil up and he \[B]wrote his secret down \[B7] \[E] \[B7]

\beginchorus
Take a \[E]point called \[B7]C in the \[E]complex \[B7]plane
Let \[E]Z1 be Z \[B7]squared plus \[E]C \[B7]
And \[E]Z2 is Z1 \[B7]squared plus \[E]C \[B7]
And \[E]Z3 is Z2 \[B7]squared plus \[E]C and so on
If the \[A]series of Z's should \[B7]always stay
\[A&]Close to C and never \[C#m]trend \[B]away
That \[A]point is in the \[B7]Mandelbrot \[E]Set
\endchorus

\beginchorus
Mandelbrot \[B7]Set you're a Rorschach Test on fire
You're a \[E]day-glo pterodactyl
You're a \[B7]heart-shaped box of springs and wire
You're one \[E]BADASS FUCKING \[E7]FRACTAL
And you're \[F#11]just in time to \[A7]save the day
\[F#11]Sweeping all our \[A7]fears away
You can \[F#11]change the world in a \[A7]tiny way \[E]
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[E]Mandelbrot's in heaven, at least he \[A]will be when he's \[F#m]dead
Right now he's \[A]still alive and \[B7]teaching math at \[E]Yale
He gave us \[E]order out of chaos, he gave us \[A]hope where there was \[F#m]none
And his \[A]geometry suc\[B7]ceeds where others \[E]fail
If you \[A7]ever lose your \[E7]way, a \[A7]butterfly will \[E7]flap its wings
From a \[A7]million miles a\[E7]way, a little \[F#m]miracle will \[B7]come to take you \[E]home \[B7]

Inkin Lincoln, sand-script with a fan
Remembering me, before it began
Sometimes I felt so Def in the Jam
Cause the ones who loved me, told me to stop
Like homegirl can’t catch shit if it drops
A superwoman chick, you know that I am
Some shit don’t fly by me in a man.

Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous

Won’t sign away my life to
Someone who’s got the flavor
But don’t have no follow through
Don’t want no Paper Gangsta
Won’t sign no monkey papers
I don’t do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don’t want no Paper Gangsta (x4)

\beginverse
Got something really shiny to start
Want me to sign there on your Range Rover heart?
I’ve heard it before
Yeah, the dinners were nice
Till your diamond words melted into some ice
You should have been rapping to the beat of my song 
Mr. California, Paper Gangsta raw 
And I’m looking for love, not an empty page 
Full of stuff that means nothing but "you’ve been played".

\beginverse
For forty days and forty nights, law was on her side
But who can stand when she`s in demand,
Her scemes and plans
`Cause we danced on the floor in the round.
So take my strong advice: Just remember to always think twice

She told my baby we danced till three, and she looked at me,
Then showed a photo. My baby cried.
His eyes were like mine.
Can we dance on the floor in the round?
\endverse

\beginverse
People always told me, be careful what you do.
And don`t go around breaking young girls' hearts.
But you came and stood right by me, just a smell of sweet perfume.
This happened much too soon. She called me to her room, hey hey
