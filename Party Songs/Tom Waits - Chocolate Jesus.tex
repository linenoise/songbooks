\beginverse                                                         
Well I \[E&m]dont go to church on sunday, dont get on my knees to \[A&m]pray
Dont memorize the books of the \[E&m]Bible, I \[B&7]got my own special way
\[E&m]I know Jesus loves me, maybe just a little bit \[A&m]more
I fall on my knees every \[E&m]Sunday at \[B&7]Zerelda Lee's candy \[E&m]store
Well it's \[E&m]got to be a chocolate Jesus, make me feel good in\[A&m]side
Got to be a chocolate \[E&m]Jesus, \[B&7]keep me satis\[E&m]fied
\endverse

\beginverse
Well I \[E&m]dont want no Abba Zabba, dont want no almond \[A&m]joy
There aint nothing better \[E&m]suitable for this \[B&7]boy
\[E&m]Well it's the only thing that can \[A&m]pick me up
\[E&m]Better than a cup of gold \[B&7]
See only a chocolate \[E&m]Jesus can \[B&7]satisfy my \[E&m]soul
\endverse

\beginverse
When the \[A&m]weather gets rough and it's whiskey in the shade
It's best to wrap your savior up in \[E&m]cellophane
He \[A&m]flows like the big muddy but thats ok 
\[B&7]Pour him over ice cream for a nice parfait
\endverse]

\beginverse
Well it's \[E&m]got to be a chocolate Jesus, good enough for me \[A&m]
Got to be a chocolate \[E&m]Jesus, \[B&7]good enough for \[E&m]me
Well it's \[E&m]got to be a chocolate Jesus, make me feel good in\[A&m]side
Got to be a chocolate \[E&m]Jesus, \[B&7]keep me satis\[E&m]fied
\endverse
