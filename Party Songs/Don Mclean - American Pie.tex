\beginverse
A \[G]long, \[D]long \[Em7]time ago, 
\[Am]I can still re\[C]member how that 
\[Em]music used to make me \[D]smile
And \[G]I know \[D]if I \[Em7]had my chance,
That \[Am]I could make those \[C]people dance and 
\[Em]maybe they'd be \[C]happy for a\[D]while
But \[Em]February \[Am]made me shiver, 
\[Em]with every paper I\[Am]'d deliver
\[C]Bad news \[G]on the \[Am]doorstep, 
I \[C]couldn't take one more \[D]step
I \[G]can't re\[D]member \[Em]if I cried when I 
\[Am7]read about his \[D]widowed bride
\[G]Something \[D]touched me \[Em]deep inside
The \[C]day the \[D7]music \[G]died \[C] \[D7]
\endverse

\beginchorus
So \[G]bye, \[C]bye Miss A\[G]merican Pie\[D]
Drove my \[G]Chevy to the \[C]levy but the \[G]levy was \[D]dry
And them \[G]good old \[C]boys were drinkin' \[G]whiskey and \[D]rye
Singin' \[Em]this will be the day that I \[A7]die, 
\[Em]this will be the day that I \[D7]die
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[G]Did you write the \[Am]book of love
And do \[C]you have faith in \[Am]god above, 
\[Em]if the bible \[D]tells you so?
\[G]Do you be\[D]lieve in \[Em]rock and roll
Can \[Am7]music save your \[C]mortal soul and 
\[Em]can you teach me \[A7]how to dance \[D]real slow?
Well I \[Em]know that you're in \[D]love with him  cause I 
\[Em]saw you dancin' \[D]in the gym
You \[C]both kicked \[G]off your \[A7]shoes, man I 
\[C]dig those rhythm and \[D7]blues
I was a \[G]lonely \[D]teenage \[Em]broncin' buck with a 
\[Am]pink carnation and a \[C]pickup truck
But I \[G]knew I \[D]was \[Em]out of luck 
the \[C]day the \[D7]music \[G]died, \[C]I started \[D7]singin'
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
Now for \[G]ten years we've been \[Am]on our own,
and \[C]moss grows fat on a \[Am]rolling stone but \
[Em]that's not how it \[D]used to be
When the \[G]jester \[D]sang for the \[Em]king and queen 
in a \[Am7]coat he borrowed \[C]from James Dean in a 
\[Em]voice that \[A7]came from you and \[D]me
And \[Em]while the king was \[D]looking down, the 
\[Em]jester stole his \[D]thorny crown
The \[C]courtroom \[G]was \[A7]adjourned, 
no \[D7]verdict was returned
And while \[G]Lenin \[D]read a \[Em]book on Marx, 
the \[Am]quartet practiced \[C]in the park
And \[G]we sang \[D]dirges \[Em]in the dark 
the day\[C] the \[G]music \[C]died, we were \[D7]singin'
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse


\beginverse
\[G]Helter skelter \[Am]in a summer swelter
\[C]the birds flew off with a \[Am]fallout shelter, 
\[Em]eight miles high and \[D]fallin' fast
It \[G]landed \[D]foul \[Em]on the grass
the \[Am7]players tried for a \[C]forward pass, 
with the \[Em]jester on the \[A7]sidelines in A \[D]cast
Now at \[Em]halftime there was \[D]sweet perfume, 
while \[Em]sergeants played a \[D]marching tune
\[C]We all got \[G]up to \[A7]dance, 
but we \[D7]never got the chance
'Cuz the \[G]players \[D]tried to \[Em]take the field, 
the \[Am]marching band re\[C]fused to yield
Do \[G]you \[D]recall what \[Em]was the feel 
the \[C] day the \[D7]music \[G]died, \[C]we started \[D7]singin'
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
And \[G]there we were all \[Am]in one place,
a \[C]generation \[Am]lost in space, 
with \[Em]no time left to \[D]start again
So come on \[G]Jack be \[D]nimble, 
\[Em]Jack be quick, \[Am7]Jack Flash sat on a \[C]candle 
stick, cause \[Em]fire is the \[A7]devil's only \[D]friend
And \[Em]as I watched him \[D]on the stage, 
my \[Em]hands were clenched in \[D]fists of rage
No \[C]angel \[G]born in \[A7]Hell 
could \[D7]break that Satan's spell
And as the \[G]flames climbed \[D]high in\[Em]to the night 
to \[Am]light the sacri\[C]ficial rite
I saw \[G]Satan \[D]laughing with \[Em]delight 
the \[C]day the \[D7]music \[G]died, \[C]he was \[D7]singin'
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
I \[G]met a \[D]girl who \[Em]sang the blues
And I \[Am]asked her for some \[C]happy news, 
but \[Em]she just smiled and \[D]turned away
I \[G]went \[D]down to the \[Em]sacred store
Where I'd \[Am]heard the music \[C]years before, 
but the \[Em]man there said the \[C]musicwouldn't \[D]play
But \[Em]in the streets \[Am]the children screamed, 
the \[Em]lovers cried and the \[Am]poets dreamed
But \[C]not a \[G]word was \[Am]spoken, 
the \[C]church bells all were \[D]broken
And the \[G]three men \[D]I ad\[Em]mire most, 
the \[Am7]Father, \[C]Son, and the \[D7]Holy Ghost
\[G]They caught the \[D]last train \[Em]for the coast 
the \[Am7]day the \[D7]music \[G]died,
And they were singin'\[D7]
