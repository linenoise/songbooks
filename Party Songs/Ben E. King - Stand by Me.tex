\beginverse
When the \[A]night has come 
\[F#m] And the land is dark
And the \[D]moon is the \[E]only light we'll \[A]see
No, I \[A]won't be afraid,
No, I \[Fm]won't be afraid
Just as lo\[D]ng as you st\[E]and, stand by \[A]me.
\endverse

\beginchorus
So, darling, darling, \[A]stand by me,
Oh, \[Fm]stand by me.
Oh, \[D]stand, \[E]stand by me,
\[A]Stand by me.
\endchorus

\beginverse
If the \[A]sky that we look upon
\[F#m]Should tumble and fall
Or the moun\[D]tain should \[E]crumble in the \[A]sea,
I won't \[A]cry, I won't cry,
No, I \[F#m]won't shed a tear
Just as lo\[D]ng as you st\[E]and, stand by \[A]me.
