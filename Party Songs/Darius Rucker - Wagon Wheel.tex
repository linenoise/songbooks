\endverse

\beginverse
\[G]Heading down south to the \[D]land of the pines
\[Em]I'm thumbing my way into \[C]North Caroline
\[G]Staring up the road and \[D]pray to God I see \[C]headlights
\[G]I made it down the coast in \[D]seventeen hours
\[Em]Picking me a bouquet of \[C]dogwood flowers
And I'm a-\[G]hopin' for Raleigh, I can \[D]see my baby to\[C]night
\endverse

\beginchorus
So \[G]rock me momma like a \[D]wagon wheel
\[Em]Rock me momma any \[C]way you feel
\[G]He-\[D]ey,  momma \[C]rock me
\[G]Rock me momma like the \[D]wind and the rain
\[Em]Rock me momma like a \[C]south bound train
\[G]He-\[D]ey,  momma \[C]rock me
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[G]Running from the cold \[D]up in New England
I was \[Em[born to be a fiddler in an \[C]old time string band
My \[G]baby plays a guitar, \[D]I pick a banjo \[C]now
Oh, \[G]north country winters keep a-\[D]getting me down
I lost my \[Em]money playing poker so I \[C]had to leave town
But I \[G]ain't turning back to \[D]living that old life \[C]no more
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[G]Walkin' to the south \[D]out of Roanoke
I caught a \[Em]trucker out of Philly had a \[C]nice long toke
But \[G]he's a heading west from the \[D]Cumberland gap
To \[C]Johnson City, Tennessee
And I \[G]otta get a move on \[D]before the sun
I hear my \[Em]baby calling my name and I \[C]know that she's the only one
And \[G]if I died in Raleigh at \[D]least I will die \[C]free
\endverse

[Chorus]

\beginverse
{\nolyrics (A capella) }
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey, momma rock me
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey,  momma rock me \[C]
So \[G]rock me momma like a \[D]wagon wheel
\[Em]Rock me momma any \[C]way you feel
\[G]He-\[D]ey,  momma \[C]rock me
\[G]Rock me momma like the \[D]wind and the rain
\[Em\]Rock me momma like a \[C]south bound train
\[G]He-\[D]ey,  momma \[C]rock me
