\beginverse
\[A]I hope that our few \[E]remaining friends
\[D]Give up on trying to \[A]save us
I \[A]hope we come up with a \[E]failsafe plot
To piss \[D]off the dumb few that \[A]forgave us
\[A]I hope the fences we \[E]mended
\[D]Fall down beneath their own \[E]weight
And I \[A]hope we hang on past the \[F#m]last exit
I \[D]hope it's already too \[E]late
\endverse

\beginverse
And \[A]I hope the junkyard a few blocks from \[F#m]here 
someday burns down
And \[D]I hope the rising black smoke carries me far away
And I never come \[E]back to this to\[D]wn again
In my \[E]life I hope I \[A]lie
And tell \[F#m]everyone you were a good wife
And I hope you \[A]die
I hope we \[E]both die \[A]

\beginverse
\[A]I hope I cut myself \[E]shaving tomorrow
\[D]I hope it bleeds all day \[A]long
Our \[A]friends say it's darkest \[E]before the sun rises
Well \[D]we're pretty sure they're all \[A]wrong
\[A]I hope it stays dark \[F]forever
\[D]I hope the worst isn't \[E]over
And \[A]I hope you blink before \[F#m]I do
I \[D]hope I never get \[E]sober
\endverse

\beginverse
And I \[A]hope when you think of me years down the line
You \[F#m]can't find one good thing to say
And I \[D]hope that when I find the strength to walk out
You'd stay the hell out of my \[E]way
I am \[D]drowning there is no sign of \[E]land
You are coming down \[A]with me, \[F#m]hand in unlovable hand
And I hope you \[A]die
I hope we \[E]both die \[A]
