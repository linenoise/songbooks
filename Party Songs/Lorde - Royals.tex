\beginverse
\[D]I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town, no post code envy
\endverse
 
\beginverse
\[D]But every song's like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room,
\[Cadd9]We don't care, we're driving \[G]Cadillacs in our dreams.
But everybody's like \[D]cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your time piece.
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash.
\[Cadd9]We don't care, we aren't \[G]caught up in your love affair.
\endverse
 
\beginverse
And we'll never be \[D]royals (royals!)
It don't run in our blood,
That kind of \[Cadd9]lux just ain't for us.
We crave a \[G]different kind of buzz.
Let me be your \[F]ruler, you can call me queen bee
And baby I'll \[Cadd9]rule I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule.
\[G]Let me live that fantasy.
\endverse
 
\beginverse
\[D]My friends and I we've cracked the code.
We count our dollars on the train to the party.
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this,
We didn't come from money.

\[D]But every song's like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room,
\[Cadd9]We don't care, we're driving \[G]Cadillacs in our dreams.
But everybody's like \[D]cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your time piece.
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash.
\[Cadd9]We don't care, we aren't \[G]caught up in your love affair.

\beginverse
And we'll never be \[D]royals..
It don't run in our blood,
That kind of \[Cadd9]lux just ain't for us.
We crave a \[G]different kind of buzz.
Let me be your \[D]ruler, you can call me queen bee
And baby I'll \[Cadd9]rule I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule.
\[G]Let me live that fantasy.
