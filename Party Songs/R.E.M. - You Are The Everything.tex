{\nolyrics Intro \[Am]}
\endverse

\beginverse
Someti\[G]mes I feel like I can't even \[D]sing
I'm very scared for \[G]this world
I'm very scared for \[D]me
Eviscerate your \[G]memory: Here's a scene
You're \[D]in the back seat laying down
The \[G]windows wrap around you
The \[D]sound of the travel and the engine
\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]All you hear is \[G]time stand still in \[C]travel
You feel such peace and \[G]absolute
The stillness still that \[C]doesn't end
But slowly drifts \[G]into sleep
The stars are the \[D]greatest thing you've ever seen
And they're there for you
For you alone you are the everything \[G]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[G]I think about this \[D]world a lot and I cry
And \[G]I've seen the films and the \[D]eyes
But I'm in this kit\[G]chen
Everything is \[D]beautiful
And she is so \[G]beautiful
She is so young and \[D]old
\endverse

\beginverse
I look at her and \[C]I see the beauty
Of the \[G]light of music
The \[C]voice is talking somewhere in the \[G]house
Late spring and you're \[C]drifting off to sleep
With your \[D]teeth in your mouth
You are here with me
You are here with me
You have been here and \[Am]you are everything
\endverse
