\beginverse
We passed upon the \[A]stairs
Spoken walls and \[Dm]wells
Although I wasn't \[A]there
He said I was his \[F]friend
Which came as so \[C]surprised
I spoke into his \[A]eyes
I thought you died \[Dm]alone
A long, long time ago \[C]
\endverse

\beginchorus
Oh no, not \[F]me
We \[B&]never lost con\[F]trol
You're fa\[B&]ce to fa\[F]ce
With the \[B&]man who sold the \[A]world
\endchorus

\beginverse
I laughed and shook his \[A]hand
Made my way back h\[Dm]ome
I searched from farther \[A]land
Years and years I roa\[F]med
I gazed all gazers the\[C]re
We walked a million \[A]hills
I must have died \[Dm]alone
A long, long time ago \[C]
