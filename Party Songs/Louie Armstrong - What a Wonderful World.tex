\beginverse
I see \[F]trees of \[Am]green, \[B&]red roses \[Am]too
\[Gm7]I see them \[F]bloom, \[A7]for me and \[Dm]you,
And I \[D&]think to myself, \[Gm7/C]What a  \[C7]wonderful \[F]world.
\endverse

\beginverse
I see \[F]skies of \[Am]blue and \[B&]clouds of \[Am]white,
\[Gm7]The bright blessed \[F]day, the \[A7]dark sacred \[Dm]night,
And I \[D&]think to myself, \[Gm7/C]what a \[C7]wonderful \[F]world
{\nolyrics: \[F] \[B&] \[F]}
\endverse

\beginchorus
The \[C7]colors of the rainbow, \[F]so pretty in the sky
Are \[C7]also on the faces of \[F]people goin' by
I see \[Dm]friends shaking \[C]hands, saying, "\[Dm]How do you \[C]do?"
\[Dm]They're really \[F#dim7]saying,
"\[Gm7]I   \[F#dim7]love    \[Gm7]you." \[C7]I hear
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[F]Babies \[Am]cry, I \[B&]watch them \[Am]grow
\[Gm7]They'll learn much \[F]more than \[A7]I'll ever \[Dm]know,
And I \[D&]think to myself \[Dm7/C]what a \[C7]wonderful \[F]world \[F] \[Am7b5]
\[D7]Yes I \[Gm7]think to myself, \[Gm7/C]what a \[C&7+9]wonderful \[F]world. \[B&6] \[F]
