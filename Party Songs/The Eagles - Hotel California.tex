\beginverse
\[Bm]On a dark desert highway, \[F#]cool wind in my hair
\[A]Warm smell of colitas \[E]rising up through the air
\[G]Up ahead in the distance, \[D]I saw a shimmering light
\[Em]My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, \[F#]I had to stop for the night
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Bm]There she stood in the doorway; \[F#]I heard the mission bell
\[A]And I was thinking to myself this could \[E]be heaven or this could be hell
\[G]Then she lit up a candle, \[D]and she showed me the way
\[Em]There were voices down the corridor, \[F#]I thought I heard them say
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G]Welcome to the Hotel \[D]California.
Such a \[Em]lovely place, such a \[Bm7]lovely face
\[G]Plenty of room at the Hotel \[D]California
\[Em]Any time of year (any time of year) you can \[F#]find it here
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[Bm]Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, \[F#]she got the Mercedes benz
\[A]She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that \[E]she calls friends
\[G]How they dance in the courtyard, \[D]sweet summer sweat
\[Em]Some dance to remember, \[F#]some dance to forget
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Bm]So I called up the Captain, \[F#]'Please bring me my wine'
\[A]He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since \[E]nineteen sixty-nine'
\[G]And still those voices are calling from \[D]far away,
\[Em]Wake you up in the middle of the night \[F#]Just to hear them say
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G]Welcome to the Hotel \[D]California.
Such a \[Em]lovely place, such a \[Bm7]lovely face
\[G]They livin' it up at the Hotel \[D]California
\[Em]What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), \[F#]bring your alibis
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[Bm]Mirrors on the ceiling, \[D]The pink champagne on ice
\[A]And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, \[E]of our own device'
\[G]And in the master's chambers, \[D]They gathered for the feast
\[Em]They stab it with their steely knives, \[F#]But they just can't kill the beast
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Bm]Last thing I remember, I was \[F#]running for the door
\[A]I had to find the passage back to the \[E]place I was before
\[G]'Relax' said the night man, \[D]We are programmed to receive.
\[Em]You can check out any time you like, \[F#] But you can never leave!'
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G]Welcome to the Hotel \[D]California.
Such a \[Em]lovely place, such a \[Bm7]lovely face
\[G]They livin' it up at the Hotel \[D]California
\[Em]What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), \[F#]bring your alibis
\endchorus
