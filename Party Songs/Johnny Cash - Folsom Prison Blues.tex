\beginverse
I \[E]hear the train a comin' it's \[E]rollin 'round the bend
and \[E]I a'int seen the sunshine since \[E]I don't know when
I'm \[A]stuck in Folsom Prison, \[A]and time keeps draggin' \[E]on.
But that \[B7]train keeps a movin' on down to-San-An-\[E]Tone
\endverse

\beginverse
When \[E]I was just a baby my \[E]mother told me, "Son
\[E]Always be a good boy, don't \[E]ever play with guns"
But I \[A]shot a man in Reno, \[A]just to watch him \[E]die
When I \[B7]hear the whistle blowin' I hang my head and \[E]cry.
\endverse

\beginverse
Well, if they \[E]freed me from this prison, if that \[E]railroad train was mine
I \[E]bet I'd move it all a little \[E]farther down the line
\[A]Far from Fulsom Prison, \[A]that's where I want to \[E]stay
And I'd \[B7]let that lonesome whistle, \[E]blow my blues away.
\endverse
