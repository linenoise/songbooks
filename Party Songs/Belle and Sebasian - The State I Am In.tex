\beginverse
\[A]I was sur\[G]prised, 
I was \[D]happy for a \[G]day in 19\[A]75 \[G]
\[F#m]I was puzzled \[Em]by a dream, 
\[D]stayed with me all \[G]day in 19\[A]95 \[G]
\[F#m]My brother \[Em]had confessed \[D]he was gay
It \[G]took the heat off \[A]me for a while \[G]
\[F#m]He stood up with a \[Em]sailor friend
\[D]Made it known u\[G]pon my sisters 
\[A]wedding day \[G] \[F#m] \[Em] \[A]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[A]I got married \[G]in a rush 
to \[D]save a kid from \[G]being deported
\[A]Now she's in love \[G]
\[F#m]I was so \[Em]touched, 
I was \[D]moved to kick the \[G]crutches
From my \[A]crippled friend \[G]
\[F#m]She was not im\[Em]pressed that 
I \[D]cured her on the \[G]Sabbath
So I \[A]went to confess \[G]
\[D]When she saw the \[D/B]funny side, 
we \[D/F#]introduced my \[D/G]child bride
To \[A]whisky and gin \[G]
Dear \[A]whiskey and gin \[G]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[A]The priest in the \[G]booth 
had a \[D]photographic \[G]memory
For \[A]all he had heard \[G]
\[F#m]He took all of my \[Em]sins 
and he \[D]wrote a pocket novel \[G]called
"The \[A]State I Am In" \[G]
\[F#m]So I gave my\[Em]self to God
There \[D]was a pregnant \[G]pause 
before he \[A]said ok \[G]
\[D]Now I spend my \[D/B]day turning 
\[D/F#]tables round In \[D/G]Marks and Spencer's
\[A]They don't seem to \[G]mind
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[D]I gave myself to sin
I ga\[F#m]ve myself to Providence
And \[C]I've been there and back again
The \[Em]state that I am in
\[D]I gave myself to sin
I ga\[F#m]ve myself to Providence
And \[C]I've been there and back again
The \[Em]state that I am in
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[A]Oh love of \[G]mine, would you 
\[D]condescend to \[G]help me
I am \[A]stupid and blind \[G]
\[F#m]Desperation \[Em]is the Devil's \[D]work, 
it is the \[G]folly of a \[A]boys empty \[G]mind
\[F#m]Now I'm feeling \[Em]dangerous, 
\[D]riding on city \[G]buses for a \[A]hobby is sad \[G]
\[D]Lead me to a \[D/B]living end
I \[D/F#]promised that I'd \[D/G]entertain my \[A]crippled friend
My \[G]crippled friend
