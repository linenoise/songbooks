\beginverse
If you \[A#]close the \[G7]door
The \[Cm]night could last \[F]forever
Leave the \[A#]sunshine \[G7]out
And \[Cm]say hello to \[F]never
\endverse

\beginverse
All the \[A#]people are dancing and they're \[A#7]having such fun
I \[D#]wish it could happen to \[D#m]me
But if you \[A#]close the \[G7]door
I'd \[Cm]never have to \[F]see the day \[A#]again
\endverse

\beginverse
If you \[A#]close the \[G7]door
The \[Cm]night could last \[F]forever
Leave the \[A#]wine glass \[G7]out
And \[Cm]drink a toast to \[F]never
\endverse

\beginverse
Oh, \[A#]someday I know someone will \[A#7]look into my eyes
And say hel\[D#]lo you're my very special \[D#m]one
But if you \[A#]close the \[G7]door           
I'd \[Cm]never have to \[F]see the day a\[A#]gain
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Dm]Dark party bars
Shiny \[A]Cadillac cars
And the \[Dm]people on \[A]subways and \[Dm]trains \[A&]
\[G]Looking gray in the rain
As they \[G7]stand disarrayed
Oh, but \[Cm] people look well in the \[F]dark
\endverse

\beginverse
If you \[A#]close the \[G7]door
The \[Cm]night could last for\[F]ever
Leave the \[A#]sunshine \[G7]out
And \[Cm]say hello to \[F]never
\endverse

\beginverse
All the \[A#]people are dancing and they're \[A#7]having such fun
I \[D#]wish it could happen to \[D#m]me
'Cause if you \[A#]close the \[G7]door
I'd \[Cm]never have to \[F]see the day ag\[A#]ain \[G7]
I'd \[Cm]never have to \[F]see the day ag\[A#]ain, \[G7]once more
I'd \[Cm]never have to \[F]see the day \[A#]again
