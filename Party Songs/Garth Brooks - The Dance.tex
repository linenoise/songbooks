\beginverse
Lookin' \[G]back on the \[C]mem'ry of the    \[D]dance we shared
'neath the \[G]stars above. \[D]
For a  \[G]moment all the     \[C]world was right how could \[D]I have known
that you'd  \[E]ever say good\[D]bye
\endverse

\beginchorus
And \[C]now, I'm glad I didn't \[D]know the way it all would \[B7]end
the way it all would \[C]g\[D]o. 
Our \[C]lives, are better left to \[D]chance. I could have missed the \[B7]pain
but I'd had have to \[C]miss \[D]the \[G]dance
\endchorus

\beginverse
Holding \[G]you I held \[C]everything 
for a \[D]moment wasn't \[G]I the king?
If I'd \[G]only known how the \[C]king would fall
Then \[D]who's to say
You know, I \[E]might have changed it \[D]all.
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
Yes my \[C]life, it's better left to \[D]chance.
I could have have missed the \[B7]pain,
but I'd had have to \[C]miss \[D]the \[G]dance.
\endverse
