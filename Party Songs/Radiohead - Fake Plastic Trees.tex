\beginverse
\[A]Her green plastic watering can \[F#m]
For her fake Chinese rubber pl\[D]ant
In the fake pl\[A]astic \[D]Earth
\[A]That she bought from a rubber man \[F#m]
In a town full of rubber pl\[D]ans
To get \[A]rid of it\[D]self

It wears her \[A]out
It wears her \[Bm]out
It wears her \[A]out
\endverse

\beginverse
\[A]She lives with a broken man \[F#m]
A cracked polystyrene \[D]man
Who just \[A]crumbles and \[D]burns
\[A]He used to do \[F#m]surgery
For girls in the eigh\[D]ties
But gravity \[A]always \[D]wins
\endverse

\beginverse
And it wears him \[Bm]out 
It wears him \[A]out
It wears him \[Bm]out
It \[A]wears
\endverse

\[A]She looks like the real \[F#m]thing
She tastes like the real th\[D]ing
My fake pl\[A]astic \[D]love
\[A]But I can't help the \[F#m]feeling
I could blow through the cei\[D]ling
If I just \[A]turn and \[D]run
\endverse

\beginverse
And it wears me \[Bm]out
It wears me \[Am]out
It wears me \[Bm]out
It wears me \[A]out
\endverse

And if I could \[Bm]be who you wanted
If I could\[A] be who you wanted
All the \[Bm]time
All the \[A]time
