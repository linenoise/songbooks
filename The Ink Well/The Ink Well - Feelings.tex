The Ink Well - Feelings

Well, we fucked with you, oooh oooh
We took samples from you, oooh oooh
Yeah, we hurt you, oooh oooh
Any way we could

Well, we stole you, oooh oooh
so we owe you, oooh oooh
We'd like to show you, oooh oooh
What it is we found

I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know
I've got feelings now
And I'm so sure

We took your children, oooh oooh
Now you miss them, oooh oooh
They grow up just like you
Yeah they do

Well, we stole you, oooh oooh
so we owe you, oooh oooh
We'd like to show you, oooh oooh
What it is we found

I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know
I've got feelings now
And I'm so sure

The universe is organized 
and intelligent 
and compassionate

Surely you must know what this means
Surely you must know what this means
Surely you must know what this means

I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know
I've got feelings now
And I'm so sure
