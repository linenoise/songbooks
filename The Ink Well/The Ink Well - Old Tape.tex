The Ink Well - Old Tape

If I had my sight, I would give it to you, 
special you

I found her in the Quarter, she had strange hair
She wore light colored clothes
And the camera cuts like mad
As it blurs and it flows

And if I had my strength I would give it to you
but who am I kidding?
who am I kidding?

And everyone would watch
It'd be perfect
We'd know what you're like for sure
And we'd speak with your tongue

And if I had my strength, I would give it to you
but who am I kidding?
who am I kidding?

Long ago I recall
From the water you birthed
Scenes like old tape
Scenes like old tape
Scenes like old tape
Scenes like old tape

And if I had my strength, I would give it to you
but who am I kidding?
who am I kidding?
