Go buy a gun it's what you must do,
You tried to sell yourself but no one wanted you,
They just left you standing there

Go get acquainted with the neighborhood kids,
They buy their ice cream from a terrorist,
But they love you just the same,
And besides,
Why wouldn't they

Oh but by the fear of God,
And those plastic chairs,
We're still just monetary drones,
And it's worse now than it was,
Well maybe you should have killed someone

The rights of workers you protected them,
And gave the children contraceptives,
And tore down the prison walls

And all your friends they were so loose and free,
They sat at home and they did nothing,
While you spread yourself around,
And after all,
Why shouldn't you

[Chorus]
Ending with: But thanks anyway,
From those of us who know what we want

Recording lives here.
