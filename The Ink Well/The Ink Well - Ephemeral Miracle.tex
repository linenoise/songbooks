The Ink Well - Ephemeral Miracle

Oh won't you take me home to a brilliant sun that never will burn out
like every other one that we've lived around at some point has done

I wrote the greatest poem, the pages fell apart, and everyone forgot
I built myself a tomb of sapphire and gold, thieves broke in and stole

(break)

A statue of myself was worshipped as a god, but tyrants seized the land
I wrote the greatest song, my home covered in ash, it never left my tongue

I tried to lead a fight I would not have begun if only it were clear
the Oracle was wrong, our enemies' success would vilify our names

(break)

I wrote it all down in a book
I captured every high and low
I wrote it down in simple math
But the library was burned
Oh, great loss!
