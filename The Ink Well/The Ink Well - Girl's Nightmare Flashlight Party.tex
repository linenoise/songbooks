The Ink Well - Girl's Nightmare Flashlight Party

When the lights go out on your metropolitan night life
before we freaked out, we grabbed our flashlights
'cause it's a good night for hidden passages!
oooh oooh, oooh oooh

When we stepped outside we shuddered at the difference
where the cobblestones and fog seemed only recent
'cause it's a good night for buried secrets

and there's nowhere you can sleep
make a fire or you will freeze
come and lay your head on me
'till you succumb to a violent hum

whose dazzleous form and superphonic shade 
arrests like eyelashes
are you my lighthouse? are you? are you?

To the north side of town, we stumble through the woods
with backpacks and flashlights
are you my lighthouse? are you? are you?

And the nightmare that we kept and the condensation of our breath
evaporates to a threat of death

and there's nowhere you can sleep
make a fire or you will freeze
come and lay your head on me
'till you succumb to a violent hum
