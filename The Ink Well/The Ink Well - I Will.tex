The Ink Well - I Will

I'll get even with your enemies and
I will overthrow your governments.
The life that they promised you
is never going to come.

I will wrap you up and nurture you and
I will teach you how to feed yourself
So far, you've only let them
chew your food for you.

And when you long for home
And when it's time to leave
I'll make you sick,
And I won't keep you long.
I won'y nail you down the way they do.

I will bathe you in the river at night and
I will lift you up the mountainside 
and show you the center of the earth
and we shall be dangerous

So when you're at your feet
your wings begin to ache
I'll snip your cord
and I will give you birth
and seat you in your glory.
