\beginverse
I'm \[A]sitting in the railway station.
Got a \[A7]ticket for my destination, \[F#]mmmm
\[Bm]On a tour of one-night stands my 
\[G]suitcase and guitar in hand.
And \[A]ev'ry stop is neatly planned 
for a \[E7]poet and \[A]one-man band.
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[A]Homeward \[D]bound,  wish I 
\[A]was, Homeward \[D]bound,
\[A]Home where my \[Asus4]thought's escaping
\[A]Home where my \[Asus4]music's playing,
\[A]Home where my l\[Asus4]ove lays waiting
\[E]Silently for \[A]me.
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[A]Every day's an endless stream
Of \[A7]cigarettes and magazines, \[F#]mmmm
And \[Bm]each town looks the same to me, 
the \[G]movies and the factories
And \[A]every stranger's face I see 
\[E7]reminds me that I \[A]long to be,
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[A]Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
I'll \[A]play the game and pretend, \[F#]mmmm
But \[Bm]all my words come back to me 
in \[G]shades of mediocrity
Like \[A]emptiness in harmony 
I \[E7]need someone to \[A]comfort me.
