\beginverse
Midnight rush, with a pen in my hand
Inkin Lincoln, sand-script with a fan
Remembering me, before it began
Sometimes I felt so Def in the Jam
Cause the ones who loved me, told me to stop
Like homegirl can’t catch shit if it drops
A superwoman chick, you know that I am
Some shit don’t fly by me in a man.
\endverse

\beginverse
Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous
\endverse

\beginverse
Don’t want no Paper Gangsta
Won’t sign away my life to
Someone who’s got the flavor
But don’t have no follow through
Don’t want no Paper Gangsta
Won’t sign no monkey papers
I don’t do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don’t want no Paper Gangsta (x4)
\endverse

\beginverse
Got something really shiny to start
Want me to sign there on your Range Rover heart?
I’ve heard it before
Yeah, the dinners were nice
Till your diamond words melted into some ice
You should have been rapping to the beat of my song 
Mr. California, Paper Gangsta raw 
And I’m looking for love, not an empty page 
Full of stuff that means nothing but "you’ve been played".
\endverse

\beginverse
Don’t want no Paper Gangsta
Won’t sign away my life to
Someone who’s got the flavour
But don’t have no follow through
Don’t want no Paper Gangsta
Won’t sign no monkey papers
I don’t do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don’t want no Paper Gangsta (x4)
