Dm               Am                    C
\[Dm]The sea wants to \[Am]kiss the golden shore \[C]
C                        G
\[C]The sunlight warms your \[G]skin
Dm              Am  
\[Dm]All the beauty \[Am]that's been lost before
C                  G 
\[C]Wants to find us a\[G]gain

\beginverse
Dm                Am   
\[Dm]I can't fight you \[Am]anymore
C                      G  
\[C]It's you I'm fighting \[G]for

\endverse

\beginchorus
Dm        Am 
We can't fall any further
C            G             Dm  
If we can't feel ordinary love
Dm         Am  
We cannot reach any higher
C            G                  Dm
If we can't deal with ordinary love
\endchorus

\beginverse
Dm         Am  
Birds fly high in the summer sky
 C                G  
And rest on the breeze
Dm                  Am 
The same wind will take care of you and
   C                              G
I    will build our house in the trees
\endverse

\beginverse
Dm            Am  
Your heart is on my sleeve
        C                 G
Did you put there with a magic marker
Dm            Am                         
For years I would believe  
          F              G
That the world couldn't wash it away
