\beginverse
\[F#]  People saving \[G#]whales,
And giving your t\[B]hanks to our se\[C#]as,
My r\[F#]espect to the ones in the \[G#]forest,
Standing \[B]up for our old t\[C#]rees
\endverse

\beginchorus
Them giving \[F#]food to the hungry,
\[B]Hope to the needy,
Giving \[C#]life to a baby,
Giving \[B]care for free,
'Cause there is \[F#]freedom around us,

We have \[B]everything we need,
And I will \[C#]care for you,
'Cause you \[B]care for me.

And we \[F#]all have opinions,
\[B]Some of them get through,
But theres \[C#]better people,
With more \[B]good to do.
Good to \[F#]do \[B] \[C#] \[C#]
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[F#]And what I have could be my \[G#]search
Or just some wo\[B]rds from my \[C#]heart
My \[F#]respect to the ones making \[G#]changes
For all the \[B]lives theyll give their \[C#]all
\endverse

{\nolyrics [Chorus]}
\endverse

\beginverse
When our \[B]world it keeps spinning round and \[F#]round it goes
Human \[B]nature keeps on spreading its \[F#]disease
And our \[B]children keep growing up with \[F#]what they know
From what we \[G#]teach and what they \[C#]see

And it's \[B]only a question of the \[F#]time we have
And the \[B]lives that our children \[C#]need
Cause they can \[B]only keep growing up with \[F#]what they know
And what we \[G#]teach, and what they \[C#]see
