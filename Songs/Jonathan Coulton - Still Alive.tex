\beginverse
\[Bm]This was a tri\[D]umph \[Bm] \[D]
I’m making a \[Bm]note here: \[D]huge succ\[Bm]ess \[D] \[Bm]
It’s \[Em]hard to over\[A]state my satis\[D]faction \[Bm] \[D]
\endverse

\beginverse
Aperture Sci\[Bm]ence \[D] \[Bm] \[D]
We \[Bm]do what we \[D]must because we \[Bm] can \[D] \[Bm]
\[Em]For the good of all of us \[A] Except the ones who\[B&m7] are dead
\endverse

\beginverse
But there’s \[F]no sense cry\[C]ing over \[B&]every mistake \[F]
You just keep \[F]on try\[C]ing till you run\[B&] out of \[F]cake
And the scie\[Gm]nce gets done\[C] and you make\[F] a neat \[Dm]gun
For the people \[B]who are \[A]still alive
\endverse

\beginverse
{\nolyrics \[D] \[Bm] \[D] \[Bm] \[D] \[Bm] \[D] }
\endverse

\beginverse
I’m \[Bm]not even \[D]angry \[Bm] \[D]
I’m being \[Bm]so sinc\[D]ere right now \[Bm] \[D] \[Bm]
Even \[Em]though you br\[A]oke my heart and ki\[D]lled me \[Bm] \[D]
\endverse

\beginverse
And \[Bm]tore me to pi\[D]eces \[Bm] \[D]
And thr\[Bm]ew every pi\[D]ece in\[Bm]to a fi\[D]re \[Bm]
\[Em]As they burned it hurt \[A]because I was so \[B&m7]happy for you
\endverse

\beginverse
Now these points of data\[F] make a beau\[C]tiful line \[B&] \[F]
And we’re out of beta\[F], we’re re\[C]leasing on time \[B&] \[F]
So I’m \[Gm]glad I got \[C]burned, think of all the \[F] things we learned \[Dm]
For the \[B]people who \[A]are still alive  
\endverse

\beginverse
{\nolyrics \[D] \[Bm] \[D] \[Bm] \[D] \[Bm] \[D] }
\endverse
 
\beginverse
\[Bm]Go ahead and \[D]leave me \[Bm] \[D]
\[Bm]I think I’d pre\[D]fer to \[Bm]stay \[D]inside \[Bm]
\[Em]Maybe you’ll find \[A]someone else to help you \[D] \[Bm] \[D]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Bm]Maybe Black \[D]Mesa \[Bm] \[D]
\[Bm]That was a \[D]joke, ha \[Bm]ha, fat \[D]chance \[Bm]
\[Em]Anyway this \[A]cake is great
It’s so \[B&m7]delicious and moist
\endverse

\beginverse
Look at me still \[F]talking when \[C]there’s \[B&]science to \[F]do
When I \[F]look out \[C]there it makes me \[B]glad I’m not \[F]you
I’ve ex\[Gm]periments to \[C]run, there is \[F]research to \[Dm]be done
On the \[B]people who \[A]are still \[D]alive \[Bm]
\endverse

\beginverse 
And be\[D]lieve me I \[Bm]am still \[D]alive \[Bm]
I’m doing \[D]science and \[Bm]I’m still \[D]alive \[Bm]
I feel fan\[D]tastic and \[Bm]I’m still a\[D]live \[Bm]
And while you’re \[D]dying I’ll \[Bm]be still a\[D]live \[Bm]
And when you’re \[D]dead I will \[Bm]be still \[D]alive \[Bm]
Still \[D] alive \[Bm]
Still \[D]alive
\endverse
