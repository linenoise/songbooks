\beginverse
We passed upon the \[A]stair, 
we spoke in was and when \[Dm]
Although I wasn't \[A]there, 
he said I was his friend \[F]
Which came as a sur\[C]prise, 
I spoke into his \[A]eyes
I thought you died al\[Dm]one, 
a long long time a\[C]go
\endverse

\beginchorus
Oh \[C]no, not \[F]me
We \[C#]never lost con\[C]trol
You're \[C]face to \[F]face
With The \[C#]Man Who Sold The World
\endchorus

\beginverse
I \[Dm]laughed and shook his \[A]hand, 
and made my way back \[Dm]home
I searched a foreign \[A]land, 
for years and years I \[F]roamed
I gazed a gazeless \[C]stare, 
we walked a million \[A]hills
I must have \[Dm]died alone, 
a long long time \[C]ago
