I \[C]heard there was a \[Am]secret chord
that \[C]David played and it \[Am]pleased the lord
but \[F]you don't really \[G]care for music, \[C]do you \[G]
well it \[C]goes like this the \[F]fourth, the \[G]fifth
the \[Am]minor fall and the \[F]major lift
the \[G]baffled king com\[Em]posing halle\[Am]lujah

\beginverse
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
she tied you to her kitchen chair
she broke your throne and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah
\endverse

\beginverse
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
\endverse

\beginverse
baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
i used to live alone before i knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
but love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
\endverse

\beginverse
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
\endverse

\beginverse
Well there was a time when you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show that to me do you
but remember when i moved in you
and the holy dove was moving too
and every breath we drew was hallelujah
\endverse

\beginverse
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
\endverse

\beginverse
Well, maybe there's a God above
but all I've ever learned from love
was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
\endverse

\beginverse
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
\endverse

\beginverse
You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah
\endverse

\beginverse
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
\endverse

\beginverse
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though It all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
\endverse
