There are \[A]places \[E]i'll re\[F#m]member\[A7]
All my \[D]li\[Dm]fe though \[A]some have changed
Some for\[A]ever \[E]not for b\[F#m]etter \[A7]
Some have \[D]gone\[Dm] and \[A]some remain

All these \[F#m]places have their m\[Bm]oments

Some are \[F#m]dead and some are li\[Bm]ving
In my \[D]life\[Dm] i've l\[A]oved them all
\endverse

\beginverse
But of \[A]all these \[E]friends\[F#m] and l\[A7]overs
\[D]There is \[Dm]no one com\[A]pares with you
\[A]And these memorie\[E]s lose \[F#m]their \[A7]meaning
\[D]When I th\[Dm]ink of \[Dm]love as \[A]something new
\endverse

\beginverse
\[F#m]Though I know I'll never lose aff\[Bm]ection
