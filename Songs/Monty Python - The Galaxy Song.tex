\beginverse
\[Fdim]Whenever life gets you \[C]down, Mrs. Brown
\[Fdim]And things seem sad or \[C]tough
And \[Fdim]people are useless, or ob\[C]noxious, or \[A]daft,
And you \[Dm]feel that you've had quite \[G7]enough... \[G]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[G]Just \[G7]re\[C]member that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
\[C]revolving at nine-hundred miles an hour
and \[G7]orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckoned,
a sun that is the source of all our \[C]power.
\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]Now the sun and you and me, and all the stars that we can see
Are \[A7]moving a million miles a \[F]day 
In an \[F7]outer spiral arm at forty \[C]thousand miles an hour
of the \[G7]galaxy we call the Milky \[C]Way.
\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]Our galaxy itself contains a hundred million stars,
\[C]it's a hundred thousand light-years side to \[G]side
it \[G7]bulges in the middle, sixty thousand light-years thick,
but out by us it's just three thousand 
light-years \[C]wide.
\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]We're thirty thousand light-years from galactic central point
We go \[A7]'round every two hundred million \[F]years,
and our galaxy \[F7]itself is one of millions of \[C]billions in this
\[G7]Amazing and expanding uni\[C]verse!
\endverse

\beginverse
The \[C]universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
in all of the directions it can \[G]whiz,
as \[G7]fast as it can go, the speed of light, y'know,
twelve million miles a minute, and that's the \[C]fastest speed there is,
\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]So remember when you're feeling very small and insecure
How a\[A7]mazingly unlikely is your \[F]birth,
And \[F7]pray that there's intelligent life \[C]somewhere up in space,
\[G7]Cause there's bugger-all down here on \[C]Earth \[G7] \[C]
\endverse
