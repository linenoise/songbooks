\beginverse
{\nolyrics Intro: Dm x4}
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Dm]There's a place your mother goes, when everybody else is soundly \[G]sleeping
\[Dm]Through the lights of Beacon street
And if you listen you can hear her \[G]weeping,
She's \[A]weeping, cause the \[B&]gentlemen are calling
\endverse

\beginverse
And the \[B&]snow is softly falling on her \[F]petticoat
And she's \[B&]standing in the harbor
And she's waiting for the sailors in the \[F]jolly boat
See how \[A]they approach
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Dm]With dirty hands and trousers torn they grapple til she's safe within their \[G]keeping
\[Dm]A gag is placed between her lips to keep her sorry tongue from
Any \[G]speaking, or \[A]screaming \[B&]
\endverse

\beginverse
And they \[B&]row her out to packets where the \[F]sailor's sorry racket
Calls for \[B&]maidenhead
And she's \[B&]scarce above the gunwales when her \[F]clothes fall to a
Bundle and she's \[A]laid in bed on the upper deck
\[Gm]La la la la laa,la la la \[A]laa,
\[Gm]La la la la laa,la la la \[A]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Dm]And so she goes from ship to ship, her ankles clasped, her arms so rudely \[G]pinioned
\[Dm]Til at last she's satisfied the lot of the marina's teeming 
\[G]Minions, in their \[A]opinions \[B&]
\endverse

\beginverse
And they \[B&]tell her not to say a thing to \[F]cousin, kindred, kith or
Kin or she'll \[B&]end up dead
And they \[B&]throw her thirty dollars and \[F]return her to the harbor
Where she \[A]goes to bed, and this is how your fed
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Gm]So be kind to your mother, though she may \[A]seem an awful bother,
and the \[Gm]next time she tries to feed you collard \[A]greens,
Remember what she does when you're asleep \[A] \[Dm]
\endverse
