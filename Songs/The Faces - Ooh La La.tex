\beginverse
\[D]Poor old Granddad  
\[Em7]I laughed at all his words
\[D]I thought he was a bitter man   
\[Em7]He spoke of women's ways
\[D]They'll trap you, then they use you  
\[Dm7]Be-fore you even know
\[D]For love is blind and you're far too kind   
\[Em7]Don't ever let it show
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[D]I wish that I knew all I know \[Em7]now   
\[G]When I was younger
\[D]I wish that I knew all I know \[Em7]now   
\[G]When I was stronger
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[D]The Can Can's such a pretty show   
\[Em7]They'll steal your heart away
\[D]But backstage, back on earth again   
\[Em7]The dressing rooms are great
\[D]They come on strong and it ain't too long   
\[Em7]Before they make you feel a man
\[D]But love is blind and you soon will find   
\[Em7]You're just a boy again

\beginverse
\[D]When you want her lips, you get a cheek   
\[Em7]Makes you wonder where you are
\[D]If you want some more and she's fast asleep   
\[Em7]Leaves you twinkling with the stars.
\[D]Poor young grandson, 
\[Em7]there's nothing I can say
\[D]You'll have to learn, just like me  
\[Em7]And that's the hardest way
