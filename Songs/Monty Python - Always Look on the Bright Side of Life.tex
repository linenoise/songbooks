\beginverse
Some \[Am]things in life are \[D]bad they can \[G]really make you \[Em]mad
Other \[Am]things just make you \[D]swear and \[G]curse

Don't \[G]grumble give a \[Em]whistle
And \[Am]this'll help things turn out for the \[D7]best
\endverse

And \[G]always \[Em]look on the \[Am]bright \[D7]side of \[G]life \[Em] \[Am] \[D7]
\[G]always \[Em]look on the \[Am]light \[D7]side of \[G]life \[Em] \[Am] \[D7]
\endchorus

\beginverse
If \[Am]life seems jolly \[D]rotten there's \[G]something you've \[Em]forgotten
and that's to \[Am]laugh and smile and \[D]dance and \[G]sing.
When you've \[Am]feeling in the \[D]dumps don't be \[G]silly \[Em]chumps
Just \[Am]purse your lips and whistle - that's the \[D7]thing
\endverse

\beginverse
For \[Am]life is quite ab\[D]surd and \[G]death's the final \[Em]word
you must \[Am]always face the \[D]curtain with a \[G]bow
For\[Am]get about your \[D]sin - give the \[G]audience a \[Em]grin
En\[Am]joy it - it's your last chance any\[D7]how.

\beginverse
\[Am]Life's a pice if \[D]shit \[G]when you look at \[Em]it
\[Am]Life's a laugh and \[D]death's a joke it's \[G]true
You'll \[Am]see it's all a \[D]show
keep 'em \[Gm]laughing as you \[Em]go
just re\[Am]member that the last laugh is on \[D7]you
