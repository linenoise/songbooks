\beginverse
When \[F]I was young and full of grace
and \[F]spirited--a rattlesnake.
When \[F]I was young and fever fell
My \[F]spirit, I will not tell
You're on \[B]your honor not to \[Gm]tell
\endverse

\beginverse
I be\[F]lieve in coyotes and time as an abstract
Ex\[F]plain the change, the difference \[Bb]between
What you want and what \[Gm]you need, there's the \[C]key,
Your adventure \[Am]for today, what do you do
Bet\[Bb]ween the horns of the \[C]day?
\endverse

And change is what \[Bb]I believe in
\endverse

\beginverse
When \[F]I was young and give and take
And \[F]foolish said my fool awake
When \[F]I was young and fever fell
My \[F]spirit, I will not tell
You're \[B]on your honor, \[Gm]on your honor
\endverse

\beginverse
\[F]Trust in your calling, 
make \[F]sure your calling's true
\[F]Think of others, the others think of \[Gm]you, 
silly \[C]rule golden words make, \[Am]practice practice makes perfect,
\[Bb]Perfect is a fault, and fault lines \[C]change

\beginverse
When \[F]I was young and full of grace
As \[F]spirited a rattlesnake
When \[F]I was young and fever fell
My \[F]spirit, I will not tell
You're \[B]on your honor, \[Gm]on your honor

I \[C]believe in example
I \[Am]believe my throat hurts
Ex\[B]ample is the checker to the \[C]key
