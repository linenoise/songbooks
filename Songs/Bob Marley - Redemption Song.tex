Old \[G]pirates, yes, they rob \[Em7]I
sold \[C]I to the \[G/B]merchant \[Am]ships

\[C] from the \[G/B]bottomless \[Am6]pit.

But my \[G]hand was \[Em7]made strong

\beginverse
Emancipate yourself from mental slavery,
None but ourselves can free our mind.
Have no fear for atomic energy,
'Cause none of them can stop the time.
\endverse

\beginverse
How long shall they kill our prophets,
While we stand aside and look?
Some say it's just a part of it,
We've got to fulfill the Book.
