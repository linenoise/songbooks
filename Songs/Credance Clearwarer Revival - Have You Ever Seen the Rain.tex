\beginverse
\[C]Someone told me long ago
\[C]There's a calm before the storm, I \[G]know
And it's been coming \[C]for some time
\[C]When it's over, so they say
\[C]It'll rain a sunny day, I \[G]know
Shining down like \[C]water
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[F]I wanna \[G]know
Have you \[C]ever \[C/B]seen the \[Am]rain \[Am/G]
\[F]I wanna \[G]know
Have you \[C]ever \[C/B]seen the \[Am]rain \[Am/G]
\[F]Coming \[G]down on a sunny \[C]day 
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[C]Yesterday and days before
\[C]Sun is cold and rain is hard, I \[G]know
Been that way for \[C]all my time
\[C]'Til forever on it goes
\[C]Thru the circle fast and slow, I \[G]know
And it can't stop, I \[C]wonder
