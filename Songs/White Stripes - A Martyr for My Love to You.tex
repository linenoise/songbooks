\beginverse
She was \[Am]sixteen and \[Em]six feet tall
In a \[D]crowd of teenagers comin' \[C]out of the zoo
She \[Am]stumbled started to \[Em]slip and fall
Teeter-\[D]tottered on the top of patent \[C]leather shoes
I \[Am]happened to \[Em]catch her and said,
``maybe \[D]these ruby shoes are a \[C]little cumbersome for you''
Maybe for \[Am]you, \[Em]now
\endverse

\beginverse
But not as shaky as I must have seemed
Talkin' junk through her giggle, little teenage dream
And on the phone I could not compete
My dumb-love fake competence was getting weak
For a sec' I thought I sounded sweet
But sure 'nough in a gruff, faint voice
I heard myself speak
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[D]I could stay a\[A]while
But \[C]sooner or later \[G]I'll break your smile
\[D]And I can \[A]tell a joke
But \[C]one of these days \[G]I'm bound to choke
\[D]And we could share a \[A]kiss

But I \[C]feel like I can't go \[G]through with this
And \[D]I bet we could \[A]build a home
But I \[C]know the right thing \[G]for me to do
Is to leave you \[Am]alone
Leave you \[Am]alone, \[Em]now
\endchorus

\beginverse
I'm beginning to like you
So you probably won't get what I'm going to do
I'm walkin' away from you
It probably don't make much sense to you
But I'm trying to save you
From all of the things that I'll probably say or do
I'll probably do
\endverse

\beginverse
{\nolyrics [Chorus]}
\endverse

\beginverse
You'll probably call me a fool
And say I'm doin' exactly what a coward would do
And I'm beginning to like you
What a shame it's a lame way to live
But what can I do?
I hope you appreciate what I do
I'm a martyr for my love for you
A martyr for my love for you, now
A martyr for my love for you
A martyr for my love for you
\endverse
