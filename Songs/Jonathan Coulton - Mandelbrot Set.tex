\beginverse
\[E]Pathological monsters! cried the \[A]terrified mathema\[F#m]tician
Every \[A]one of them is a \[B7]splinter in my \[E]eye
I hate the \[E]Peano Space and the Koch Curve
I fear the \[A]Cantor Ternary \[F#m]Set
The Sier\[A]pinski Gasket \[B7]makes me want to cry \[E]
And a \[A7]million miles \[E7]away a \[A7]butterfly \[E7]flapped its wings
On a \[A7]cold November \[E7]day.. a \[F#m]man named Benoit \[B7]Mandelbrot was \[E]born
\endverse

\beginverse
\[E]His disdain for pure mathematics and his \[A]unique geometrical \[F#m]insights
Left him \[A]well equipped to \[B7]face those demons down\[E]
He saw that \[E]infinite complexity could be \[A]described by simple \[F#m]rules
He used his \[A]giant brain to \[B]turn the game around\[E]
And he \[A7]looked below the storm and \[E7]saw a vision in his head
A \[A7]bulbous pointy form\[E7]
He picked his \[F#m]pencil up and he \[B]wrote his secret down \[B7] \[E] \[B7]
\endverse

\beginchorus
Take a \[E]point called \[B7]C in the \[E]complex \[B7]plane
Let \[E]Z1 be Z \[B7]squared plus \[E]C \[B7]
And \[E]Z2 is Z1 \[B7]squared plus \[E]C \[B7]
And \[E]Z3 is Z2 \[B7]squared plus \[E]C and so on
If the \[A]series of Z's should \[B7]always stay
\[A&]Close to C and never \[C#m]trend \[B]away
That \[A]point is in the \[B7]Mandelbrot \[E]Set
\endchorus

\beginchorus
Mandelbrot \[B7]Set you're a Rorschach Test on fire
You're a \[E]day-glo pterodactyl
You're a \[B7]heart-shaped box of springs and wire
You're one \[E]BADASS FUCKING \[E7]FRACTAL
And you're \[F#11]just in time to \[A7]save the day
\[F#11]Sweeping all our \[A7]fears away
You can \[F#11]change the world in a \[A7]tiny way \[E]
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[E]Mandelbrot's in heaven, at least he \[A]will be when he's \[F#m]dead
Right now he's \[A]still alive and \[B7]teaching math at \[E]Yale
He gave us \[E]order out of chaos, he gave us \[A]hope where there was \[F#m]none
And his \[A]geometry suc\[B7]ceeds where others \[E]fail
If you \[A7]ever lose your \[E7]way, a \[A7]butterfly will \[E7]flap its wings
From a \[A7]million miles a\[E7]way, a little \[F#m]miracle will \[B7]come to take you \[E]home \[B7] 
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
And you're \[F#11]just in time to \[A7]save the day
\[F#11]Sweeping all our \[A7]fears away
You can \[F#11]change the world in a \[A7]tiny way
Go on \[F#11]change the world in a \[A7]tiny way
Come on \[F#11]change the world in a \[A7]tiny way
\endverse
