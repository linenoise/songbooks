\beginverse
Now \[Am7]somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a \[D7sus4]young boy named Rocky Ra\[D7]coon
\[G7] And one day his woman ran off with a\[C]nother guy
\[C/B]Hit young Rocky in the eye \[Am7]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Am7]   Rocky didn't like that
He said ``I'm \[D7sus4]gonna get that boy'' \[D7]
So one \[G7]day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the \[C]local saloon \[C/B]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Am7]Rocky Raccoon checked \[D7sus4]into his \[D7]room
\[G7]Only to find Gideon's\[C] bible \[C/B]
\[Am7]Rocky had come \[D7sus4]equipped with a \[D7]gun
To \[G7]shoot off the legs of his \[C]rival \[C/B/]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Am7]His rival it seems had \[D7sus4]broken his \[D7]dreams
By \[G7]stealing the girl of his \[C]fancy \[C/B]
Her \[Am7]name was Magil and she \[D7sus4]called herself \[D7]Lil
But \[G7]everyone knew her as \[C] Nancy \[C/B]
\endverse

\beginverse
Now \[Am7]she and her man who \[D7sus4]called himself \[D7]Dan
Were \[G7]in the next room at the \[C]hoe down \[C/B]
\[Am7]Rocky burst in and \[D7sus4]grinning a \[D7]grin
He said \[G7]``Danny boy this is a s\[C]howdown'' \[C/B]
\endverse

\beginverse
But \[Am7]Daniel was hot- he \[D7sus4]drew first and \[D7]shot
And \[G7]Rocky collapsed in the \[C]corner \[C/B]

\endverse

\beginverse
Now the \[Am7]doctor came in \[D7sus4]stinking of \[D7]gin
And pro\[G7]ceeded to lie on the \[C]table \[C/B]
He said "\[Am7]Rocky you met your match"
And Rocky \[D7sus4]said, "Doc it's only a \[D7]scratch
And I'll be \[G7]better, I'll be better doc as soon as I \[C]am able" \[C/B]
\endverse

\beginverse
Now \[Am7]Rocky Raccoon he fell \[D7sus4]back in his \[D7]room 
\[G7]Only to find Gideon's \[C]bible \[C/B]
\[Am7]Gideon checked out and he \[D7sus4]left it no \[D7]doubt
To \[G7]help with good Rocky's revival \[C] \[C/B]
