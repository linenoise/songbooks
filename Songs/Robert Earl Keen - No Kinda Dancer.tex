\endverse

\beginverse
The \[D]first of the month \[Bm]Brings back the notion
Of a \[G]big round white dance hall and a cool summer \[A]night
\[D]Red cherry faces set \[Bm]black shoes in motion
To the \[G]oom pa pa rhythm of a \[A]German delight
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[Bm]And I tried hard to tell you I was \[A]no kinda dancer
But \[Bm]you took my hand to \[G]prove I was wrong
You \[D]guided me gently Though I \[Bm]thought I could never
We were \[G]dancing \[A]together at the \[G]end of the \[D]song
\endchorus

\beginverse
A \[D]taught little bald man like a \[Bm]German war hero
With \[G]buxom matrons to a quick John Paul \[A]Jones
\[D]Drapes of crepe paper, a \[Bm]ball made of mirror
Cast \[G]shiny reflections on a brass slide \[A]trombone
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
A \[D]man was still dancing with \[Bm]his phantom partner
Though the \[G]band had quit playing at the \[A]evening's end
And it \[D]made me feel lucky that \[Bm]I had a partner
to \[G]teach me the dance steps and come back \[A]again
