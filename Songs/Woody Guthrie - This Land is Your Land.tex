\gtab{G}{320003}

\beginchorus
\[D]This land is \[G]your land, this land is \[D]my land,
From Calif\[A7]ornia to the New York \[D]Island,
From the Redwood F\[G]orests to the Gulf Stream wa\[D]ters;
\[A7]This land was made for you and \[D]me.
\endchorus

\beginverse
As I was \[G]walking that ribbon of \[D]highway,
I looked \[A7]above me, there in the \[D]skyway,
I saw b\[G]elow me, the Golden \[D]Valley;
\[A7]This land was made for you and \[D]me.
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
I roamed and \[G]rambled, and followed my \[D]footsteps
Through the sparkling \[A7]sands of her diamond \[D]deserts,
And all a\[G]round me this voice kept \[D]saying,
"\[A7]This land was made for you and \[D]me."
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
As the Sun was \[G]shining, and I was \[D]strolling
Through the wheat fields \[A7]waving and the dust clouds \[D]rolling,
I could feel \[G]inside me and see all \[D]around me,
\[A7]This land was made for you and \[D]me.
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
As I went \[G]walking I saw a \[D]sign there
And on the sign it \[A7]said "No \[D]Trespassing."
But on the other \[G]side it didn't say \[D]nothing,
\[A7]That side was made for you and \[D]me.
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
In the \[G]shadow of the steeple I saw my \[D]people,
By the \[A7]relief office I seen my \[D]people;
As they \[G]stood there hungry, I stood there \[D]asking
\[A7]Is this land made for you and \[D]me?
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
Nobody \[G]living can ever \[D]stop me,
As I go \[A7]walking that freedom \[D]highway;
Nobody \[G]living can ever \[D]make me turn back
\[A7]This land was made for you and \[D]me.
\endverse
