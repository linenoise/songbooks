\beginverse
We have cleared off the table, the leftovers saved
Washed the dishes, and put them away
I have told you a story and tucked you in tight
At the end of your knockabout day

As the moon sets its sail to carry you to sleep
Over the midnight sea
I will sing you a song that no one sang to me
May it keep you good company
\endverse

\beginchorus
You can be anybody that you want to be
You can love whomever you will
You can travel any country where your heart leads
And know I will love you still

You can live by yourself, you can gather friends around
You can choose one special one
But the only measure of your words and your deeds
Will be the love you leave behind when you're gone.
\endchorus

\beginverse
Some girls grow up strong and bold, 
Some boys are quiet and kind
Some race on ahead, some follow behind
Some grow in their own way and time

Some women love women, some men love men
Some raise children, and some never do
You can dream all the day, never reaching the end
Of everything possible for you.

Don't be rattled by names, by taunts or games,
But seek out spirits true
If you give your friends the best part of yourself
They will give the same back to you.
\endverse

\beginverse
[CHORUS]

Oh yes, the love you leave behind when you're gone
\endverse
