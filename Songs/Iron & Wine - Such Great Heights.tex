\beginverse
\[F#]I'm thinking it's a \[C#]sign 
that the freckles in our \[B+]eyes are mirror images and 
\[F#]when we kiss they're \[C#]perfectly aligned
\endverse

\beginverse
And \[F#]I have to specul\[C#]ate 
that god himself did \[B+]make us into corresponding shapes 
\[F#]like puzzle \[C#]pieces from the clay
\endverse

\beginverse
\[F#]And true, it may seem like a \[C#]stretch, 
but it's thoughts like this that \[B+]catch my troubled head when you're away 
\[F#]when I am \[C#]missing you to death
\endverse

\beginverse
\[F#]When you're there on the \[C#]road 
for several weeks of \[B+]shows and when you scan the radio 
\[F#]I hope this \[C#]song will guide you home
\endverse

\beginverse
\[F#]They will see us waving from \[C#]such great heights, 
come \[B+]down now, they'll say \[F#] \[C#]
\[F#]but everything looks perfect from \[C#]far away, 
come \[B+]down now, but we'll \[F#] stay \[C#]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[F#]I try my best to \[C#]leave
this all on your ma\[B+]chine but the persistent beat it 
\[F#]sounded thin up\[C#]on listening
\endverse

\beginverse
And \[F#]that frankly will not \[C#]fly, 
you will hear the shrillest \[B+]highs and lowest lows with the windows down 
\[F#]when this is \[C#]guiding you home
\endverse

\beginverse
\[F#]They will see us waving from \[C#]such great heights, 
come \[B+]down now, they'll say \[F#] \[C#]
\[F#]but everything looks perfect from \[C#]far away, 
come \[B+]down now, but we'll \[F#] stay \[C#]
\endverse
