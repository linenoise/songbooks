\beginverse
\[Em/G] "The problem is \[D6]all inside your \[Cmaj7]head", she said to \[B7-9]me \[B7]
\[Em] The answer is \[D#07]easy if you \[Gmaj9+5]take it logical\[B+]ly
\[Em] I'd like to \[D6]help you in your \[Cmaj7]struggle to be \[B7-9]free
There \[B7]must be \[Em] fifty \[Am7]ways to leave your \[Em]lover
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Em/G] She said it's \[D6]really not my \[Cmaj7]habit to in\[B7-9]trude \[B7]
Further\[Em]more, I hope my \[D#07]meaning won't be \[Gmaj7+9]lost or miscon\[B+]strued
But \[Em]I'll repeat my\[D6]self at the \[Cmaj7]risk of being \[B7-9]crude
There \[B7]must be \[Em] fifty \[Am7]ways to leave your \[Em]lover
Fifty \[Am7]ways to leave your \[Em]lover
\endverse

\beginchorus
Just slip out the \[G]back, Jack
Make a new \[B&6]plan, Stan
You don't need to be \[C7]coy, Roy
Just get yourself \[G]free
Hop on the \[G]bus, Gus
You don't need to dis\[B&6]cuss much
Just drop off the \[C7]key, Lee
And get yourself \[G]free
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[Em/G] She said it \[D6]grieves me so to \[Cmaj7]see you in such \[B7-9]pain
I \[B7]wish there was \[Em] something I could \[D#07]do to \[Gmaj9+5]make you smile a\[B+]gain
\[Em] I said I ap\[D6]preciate that and \[Cmaj7]would you please ex\[B7-9]plain
A\[B7]bout the \[Em]fifty ways \[Am7] \[Em]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Em/G] She said why \[D6]don't we both just \[Cmaj7]sleep on it to\[B7-9]night
And \[B7]I be\[Em]lieve in the \[D#07]morning you'll be\[Gmaj9+5]gin to see the \[B+]light
And then she \[Em]kissed me and I \[D6]realized she \[Cmaj7]probably was \[B7]right
There \[B7]must be \[Em] fifty \[Am7]ways to leave your \[Em]lover
Fifty \[Am7]ways to leave your \[Em]lover
\endverse

[Chorus] (x2)
