\beginverse
Lonely mother gazes out of a window
Looking at a sun that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side 
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
\endverse

\beginverse
But all the praying just ain't helping at all 
Cause he can't seem to keep himself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how 
Another body lying cold in the gutter.
\endverse

\beginchorus
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes like you used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all 
But I think you're moving too fast
\endchorus

\beginverse
Little precious has a natural obsession 
For temptation but he just can't see
She gives him lovin' that his body can't handle 
All that he can say is baby it's good to me
\endverse

\beginverse
One day he stops and takes a look in the mirror 
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is failing and he doesn't know why 
Three letters took him to his final resting place.
\endverse
