\beginverse
Stand \[A]up all victims of \[D]oppression 
For the \[E7]tyrants fear \[A]your \[E7]might
Don't \[A]cling so hard to your \[D]possessions 
For you have \[E7]nothing if you have no \[A]rights!
Let \[E]racist \[B7]ignorance be \[E]ended
For re\[B7]spect makes the empires \[E]fall \[B7]
Freedom is \[E]merely \[E7]privilege \[A]extended
Unless en\[E]joyed by \[B7]one and \[E]all \[E7]
\endverse

\beginchorus
So come \[A]brothers and \[D]sisters
For the \[E7]struggle carries \[A]on \[E7]
The \[A]Inter\[E7]national\[F#m]e \[C#7]
U\[D]nites the \[B7]world in \[E]song \[E7]
So come \[A]comrades and \[D]rally
For this \[E7]is the time and \[A]place \[A7]
The \[F#7]international\[Bm7] ideal
U\[A]nites the \[E7]human \[A]race
\endchorus

\beginverse
Let \[A]no one build walls to \[D]divide us
Walls of \[E7]hatred or \[A]walls of \[E7]stone
Come \[A]greet the dawn and stand \[D]beside us
We'll live \[E7]together or we'll \[A]die alone
In our \[E]world \[B7]poisoned by \[E]exploitation
Those who have \[B7]taken, now they must \[E]give \[B7]
And \[E]end the \[E7]vanity of \[A]nations
We have \[E]but one \[B7]world on which \[E]to live \[E7]
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
And \[A]so begins the final \[D]drama
In the \[E7]streets and \[A]in the \[E7]fields
We \[A]stand unbowed before their \[D]armor
We defy \[E7]their guns and \[A]shields
When we \[E]fight \[B7]provoked by their \[E]aggression
Let us be \[B7]inspired by \[E]life and \[B7]love
For \[E]though they \[E7]offer us \[A]concessions
Change \[E]will not \[B7]come from \[E]above \[E7]
