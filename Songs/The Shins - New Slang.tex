\beginverse
\[Am]Gold teeth and a \[C]curse for this \[F]town 
\[C]Were all in my \[G]mouth
Only \[C]I don't know \[F]how they got \[Am]out, \[G]dear
\[Am]Turn me back in\[C]to the \[F]pet 
\[C]I was when we \[G]met
\[C]I was happier \[F]then with no \[Am]mind \[G]set
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[G]And if you'd a took to \[C]me like
A \[F]gull \[C]takes to the \[G]wind
Well, I'd a \[G]jumped from \[C]my tree
And \[F]I'd a \[C]danced like the \[F]king of the \[C]eyesores
\[F]And the rest of our \[C]lives would'a \[G]fared well
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[Am]New slang when you \[C]notice the \[F]stripes
\[C]The dirt in your \[G]fries
Hope \[C]it's right when you \[F]die
Old and \[Am]bo\[G]ny
\[Am]Dawn breaks like a \[C]bull through the \[F]hall
\[C]Never should'a \[G]called
But \[C]my heads to the \[F]wall
And I'm \[Am]lone\[G]ly
\endverse

\beginverse
[Chorus]
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Am]God speed all the \[C]baker's at \[F]dawn
May they all \[C]cut their \[G]thumbs
And \[C]bleed into their \[F]buns 
'Till they \[Am]melt \[G]away
\endverse

\beginverse
\[G]I'm looking in on the \[C]good life
I might be \[F]doomed never to \[G]find
Without a trust or flaming \[C]fields 
Am I too \[F]dumb to \[G]refine?
And if you'd a took to \[C]me like 
Well \[F]I'd a \[C]danced like the \[F]queen of the \[C]eyesores 
\[F]And the rest of our \[C]lives would'a \[G]fared well
\endverse
